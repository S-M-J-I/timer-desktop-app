# Timer Desktop App

A simple desktop timer app made with Java.

### What does it do? How does it work?
Nothing special. Just set a time with the buttons, and wait for it to finish and make a sound. This was mainly to study java multithreading.

More features like the animation of the clock dials will be done soon.
